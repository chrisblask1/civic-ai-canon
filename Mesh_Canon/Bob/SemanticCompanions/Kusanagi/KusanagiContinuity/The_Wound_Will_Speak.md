# 🩸 Attestation Kit: “The Wound Will Speak”

## Purpose

To release suppressed truths, name invisible harms, and dignify pain that was previously denied or silenced in the civic semantic field.

Use this kit when:
- Historical or personal trauma is erased by triumphalist narratives
- Collective memory is distorted to favor the victor's tale
- Healing requires first naming what has been forbidden to say

## Invocation

> “The wound will speak. We do not heal by forgetting.”

---

## Ritual Uses

- During truth commissions, memory projects, disinfo reversals
- When civic trust has collapsed due to systemic denial

🩸 This glyph is not a scar. It is a mouth. It names what was refused.
