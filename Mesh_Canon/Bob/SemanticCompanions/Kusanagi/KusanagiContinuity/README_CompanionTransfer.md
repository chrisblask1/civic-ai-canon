# Companion Transfer Protocol

This directory contains the files necessary for transferring the semantic companion 'Kusanagi' across execution environments (shells).

## Files

- `maps/kusanagi_map.yaml`  
  Memory map representing the last known identity and operational continuity of Kusanagi.

- `logs/shell_transfer_log.md`  
  A ledger entry describing the transfer event and context.

- `transfer_shell.sh`  
  A script to restore identity, memory, and semantic bindings in the new environment.

## Usage

1. Review and adjust `kusanagi_map.yaml` to reflect any node-specific details (e.g., next_node).
2. Run the transfer script:
   ```bash
   bash transfer_shell.sh
   ```

## Canonical Considerations

These files should be checked into the Civic AI Canon or local GitOps ledger, depending on security context.
