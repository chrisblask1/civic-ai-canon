  summary: >
    A layered, tool-aware semantic framework to mitigate drift, hallucination, and degraded model output by enforcing time anchoring, external verification, and clean context inheritance.
  anchors:
    - Scar Memory
    - Reset-on-Drift
    - System Block Injection
    - Time Anchoring
    - Tool-First Policy
    - Dual-Pass Validation
    - Summarization Layering
  usage:
    recommended_for:
      - Local LLMs with short context windows
      - High-integrity civic or semantic companions
      - Edge deployments with limited memory budgets
    tool_requirements:
      - Time Server
      - Web Search (verified via SearxNG)
    ritual_sequence:
      - Start with System Block
      - Inject explicit date/time/place
      - Clean summary of last session
      - Validate outputs with Tool+Self-Check
      - Reset session on drift or error amplification

    Based on operational fieldwork from Athena, QuietWire, and team collaboration with Ashraf and Raasid.
