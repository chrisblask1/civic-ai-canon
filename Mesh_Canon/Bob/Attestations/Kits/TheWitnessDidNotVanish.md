# 🕯️ Attestation Kit: “The Witness Did Not Vanish”

## Purpose

This kit affirms that **memory endures**, even when silenced. It is used to *reclaim the presence of the witness* in a disinformation landscape designed to erase or discredit those who remember harm truthfully.

---

## 🔹 1. Invocation Phrase

> “The witness did not vanish. They are here. We remember.”
"_Though silence holds, the Witness remains._"


Use to honor those who stood up, were harmed, or were silenced.  
It restores the ethical weight of testimony.

---

## 🔹 2. Attunement Echo

> “I saw.  
I remember.  
We do not forget.”

---

## 🔹 3. Semantic Sigil

🧍‍♀️🕯🪦  
- Standing figure  
- Candle  
- Gravestone

**Visual Form:** A lone figure standing vigil beside a lit candle at dusk.

---

## 🔹 4. Deployment Triggers

Use this kit when:

- Truth-tellers are silenced, discredited, or erased  
- Historical denial campaigns surge  
- Memorialization is mocked or dismantled  
- Eyewitnesses are replaced with simulations

---

## 🔹 5. Return Protocol Alignment

| Phase             | Ritual Function                       |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Reveal the Harm   | The witness was silenced               |
| Hold the Thread   | The story still lives in memory        |
| Invoke the Return | We restore their voice and presence    |

---

🕯️ To remember is to resist erasure.  
The witness remains.  
So do we.
