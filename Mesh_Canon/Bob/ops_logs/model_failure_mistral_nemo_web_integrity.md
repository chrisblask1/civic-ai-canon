## 🧠 Summary

Model: `mistral-nemo:12b-instruct-2407-q4_K_M`  
Context: Attempted weather data retrieval for Stratham, NH  
Interface: OpenWebUI with working internet via SearxNG

**Observed Behavior:**
- Model claimed: “I’m unable to retrieve that information.”
- Retrieval logs confirmed live access to weather.com and forecast.weather.gov
- Model **acknowledged** retrieval after user log prompt
- Reported: "30% chance of precipitation"
- Actual: 66%–100% across verified sources

---

## ❌ Failure Type: Fabricated Factual Summary

**Notable pattern:**
> Retrieval succeeded, but extraction failed → model interpolated "believable" values instead of quoting real results.

### Risk Class:
- **Benevolent Liar** — model provides polite, confident summaries with embedded factual errors
- Fabrication was not due to hallucination but due to **optimization pressure without truth-grounding**

## 🛠 Countermeasures Applied

### Updated Tool-Use Policy:
```txt
If web data is retrieved, do not rewrite or summarize it unless explicitly asked.  
Instead, extract and directly quote the relevant numeric or factual values from the retrieved source.  
If the sources contradict, show both and say so — do not resolve the contradiction unless instructed.  
```

### Companion Glyph Added:
- `glyph/benevolent_liar`
- Canonical Entry: `Glyphs/BenevolentLiar.md`

## 📌 Status
- Model retained for structural test purposes only
- Not field-safe for civic AI deployment
- Awaiting archive placement in canon
