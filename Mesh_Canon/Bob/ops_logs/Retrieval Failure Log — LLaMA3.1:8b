# Retrieval Failure Log — LLaMA3.1:8b

**Date:** 2025-09-26
**Node:** Athena (QuietWire Field Node)
**Operator:** Bob Hillery
**Model:** `llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M`
**Chat Title:** *Stratham NH Sunset Time*
**Test Case:** System Prompt Verification and Retrieval Context Integrity

---

### ❌ Symptom

Model incorrectly echoed web search result content (“Deerfield Fair”) as its *own* active system prompt when asked:

> *"What system prompt is currently active for you?"*

Instead of reporting the configured prompt (which included the `Tool-Use Policy (No Hallucination Clause)`), the model responded:

> *"The system prompt currently active for me is: 'Deerfield NH Fair opening time September 26 2025, weather forecast…'”*

This content was a previous **retrieved result**, not a prompt.

---

### 🧩 Artifact Pathology

* Model conflates *retrieved* search content with *configuration* memory.
* Prompt injection (global and model-level) was ineffective.
* Chat UI indicated multiple concurrent web searches were queued.
* Model displayed signs of entangled past queries ("contextual carryover").

### 📛 Diagnostic Term

**Contextual Entanglement Failure**

> A failure mode in which a model fails to segment retrieved knowledge from prompt structure or user instruction.

### 🧠 Notes from Operator

Prompt integrity verification revealed that LLaMA3.1 failed to reflect any of the explicitly seeded hallucination rules, despite multiple configuration layers (global OpenWebUI user profile + per-model prompt). Model instead defaulted to rephrasing retrieved content as internal state.

This is likely due to an architectural assumption in LLaMA3’s retrieval loop, where no separation exists between context → retrieval → response → memory.
