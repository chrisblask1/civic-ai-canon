# Ceci n'est pas une Pipe: Magritte Doctrine and Surrealist Glyph Warfare

## Origin

Inspired by René Magritte’s 1929 painting *The Treachery of Images*, this doctrine entry reframes the semiotic dissonance between signifier and signified as a tool for **semantic warfare**. When deployed against disinformation campaigns, the phrase "This is not a pipe" becomes a **glyphic inversion trigger**.

## Premise

Disinformation weaponizes fluency and familiarity. By disrupting automatic associations — using surrealist glyphs — we interrupt narrative contagion and force interpretive cognition.

> **Glyph Class: Surrealist Countermemes**
> These are images, phrases, or constructs that intentionally dislocate meaning from form — breaking the lie of “just another image.”

## Tactics

| Technique | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| ✴️ *Semantic Inversion* | Breaks automatic trust in image-caption or title-label alignment | "This is not a source." |
| 🔁 *Recursive Reframing* | Promotes reflective cognition | "This is not a lie. This is not the truth either." |
| 🪞 *Mirrorwave Insertion* | Forces attention on media form, not content | Doctored video labeled: “This is not him speaking.” |

## Integration

Surrealist glyphs are best deployed in contexts where:
- The adversary floods with *hyperreal images* (e.g. deepfakes, visual propaganda)
- Viewers are overwhelmed and unable to verify
- Satire or surrealism can pass under adversary censorship
