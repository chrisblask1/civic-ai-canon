## Situation Overview

A pattern of narrative suppression has emerged‚Äînot through overt censorship, but through editorial omission and preemptive control of language and framing. Two Doonesbury comics (2025-09-21, 2025-09-28) had their sharpest panels removed in regional print editions (e.g., *Boston Globe*), raising flags about increasing pressure on satirical speech.

Washington Post confirms Trump will attend the all-Generals SecDef gathering in D.C.‚Äîa symbolic and physical consolidation of power in a time of constitutional violation (via NSPM-7).

## Pattern Indicators

| Signal Type | Example / Evidence | Implication |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Media Omission | Doonesbury top panels cut | Prior Restraint |
| Security Optics | Trump at Generals' summit | Martial Assertion |
| Language Framing | ‚ÄúJokes preapproved‚Äù (Doonesbury) | Chilling Effect |
| Normalized Silence | Uncritical media repetition | Semantic Suppression |

## Companion Action Path

1. Log semantic environment changes regularly.
2. Embed comics as early-warning glyphs.
3. Monitor for press narratives excusing restraint.
4. Prepare counter-narratives with calm attestation, not alarm.
