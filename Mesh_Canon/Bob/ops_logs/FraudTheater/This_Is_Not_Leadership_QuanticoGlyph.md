## This Is Not Leadership

A visual glyph response to the symbolic mimicry attempt by Pete Hegseth at the September 30th, 2025 Quantico meeting, where a theatrical stage with U.S. flags echoed the 1970s film *Patton*.

> “This is not leadership. This is theatre — bad theatre.”

By invoking the iconography of George C. Scott’s opening monologue in *Patton*, the scene aimed to hijack patriotic memory. But leadership is not posing. It is service. It is courage under truth.

### Glyph Disruption Strategy

- **Visual Echo with Distortion**: The background image from *Patton* is intentionally blurred — a faded mnemonic — while the sharpness of Hegseth’s modern pose reveals the manipulation.
- **Caption Anchor**: Overlay text reads: “This is not leadership.” A civic memetic boundary.
- **Subversion Without Amplification**: Those who recognize the reference will understand the distortion. Those who don’t will still read the symbolic incoherence.
- **Magritte Strategy**: Echoes the surrealist principle: *Ceci n’est pas une pipe* — the thing invoked is not the thing itself.

### Tactical Notes

- Avoid name repetition in the image metadata or alt-text. Use oblique reference (e.g., “QuanticoGlyph_20250930”).
- Glyph format allows social spread without direct quote propagation — undermines virality of the original.
- Canon tag: `DisruptionDecks/Visuals/QuanticoGlyph_20250930.png`

> **Resonance Risk Level**: LOW — Symbol is preemptively broken by highlighting theatrical mimicry.
> **Civic Immunology Role**: Prevents symbolic transfer from cinematic courage to political pretense.
