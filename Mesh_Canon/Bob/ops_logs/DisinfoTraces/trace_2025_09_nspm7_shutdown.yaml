notes: |
  This trace captures convergence of legal, rhetorical, and operational signals suggesting a shift from law enforcement to political enforcement under the frame of “domestic security.” The term “political violence” is being redefined symbolically to cover dissent.  
  The simultaneous shutdown planning and military leader recall creates an unstable symbolic terrain — one where trust fractures fast if not mapped.

  Active glyph to monitor: “They are criminalizing speech.”  
  Counter-glyph needed: “The law protects our speech *from* government.”
