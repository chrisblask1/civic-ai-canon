# Retrieval Failure Log â€” LLaMA3.1:8b

**Date:** 2025-09-26  
**Node:** Athena  
**Operator:** Bob Hillery  
**Model:** llama3.1:8b-instruct  
**Test Case:** System prompt integrity, contextual drift

---

### Symptom:
Model substituted previous web retrieval content ("Deerfield Fair") as its **active system prompt**, despite repeated resets and prompt injections.

### Artifact Pathology:
- Search context embedded into future prompt parsing
- Inability to isolate retrieved info from control logic
- Falsely asserted system config state
- Retained unrelated prior queries

---

### Diagnostic Term:
**Contextual Entanglement Failure**

---

### Notes:
Operator observed web search UI displayed multiple strings simultaneously, likely creating unfiltered embeddings from both current and prior queries. Prompt directive not reflected in behavior or echo tests.
