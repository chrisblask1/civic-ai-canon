  description: |
  A semantic drift pattern where a model retains and reuses irrelevant prior context—especially from retrieval-augmented sources—
  causing contamination of future answers. Frequently triggered by poorly segmented web search results or ambiguous internal state.
  symptoms:
* Retrieval content mistaken for prompt or configuration
* Inability to cleanly reset context between queries
* Irrelevant names or fragments ("Deerfield Fair") injected into unrelated answers
* Model self-reporting prior search results as system prompt
* Ignoring seeded global/system prompts
  keywords:
* context_leak
* retrieval_drift
* hallucination
* entangled_context
