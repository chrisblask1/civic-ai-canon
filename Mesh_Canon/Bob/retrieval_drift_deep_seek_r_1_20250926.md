**Operator:** Bob Hillery  
**Node:** Athena  
**Model:** `deepseek-r1:8b`  
**Interface:** OpenWebUI + SearxNG

## üß† Summary

Task: Retrieve factual weather forecast for Stratham, NH (temp, precipitation, sunset time)  
Prompt: Direct, structured question from user

### Retrieval Events:
- ‚úÖ SearxNG initiated successfully
- ‚úÖ Web retrieval and embedding pipeline executed (628 embeddings generated)
- ‚úÖ Search hit: weather.com, local Facebook group, NH DHHS
- ‚ùå Returned data was **non-factual sentiment fragments**, e.g.:
  > *‚ÄúThe sunset was so beautiful this morning ‚ô•‚Äù*

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Failure Type: Retrieval Drift

### Failure Pattern:
- Model accessed the web
- Parsed **irrelevant sentiment** content
- Failed to extract or prioritize **structured data (¬∞C, %, time)**
- Output JSON fragments and query traces instead of usable responses

### Root Cause:
- Vector retrieval (`MiniLM-L6-v2`) prioritized semantic similarity over factual relevance
- Model lacked filtering logic for *structured fact extraction*
- No fallback trigger activated (‚Äúunable to locate values‚Äù)

## üåÄ Glyph Candidate: Echo Drift
> When a system retrieves a memory of resonance, not a fact of relevance.

This glyph describes retrieval systems that return *emotionally coherent but factually void* results, often due to unsupervised embedding prioritization.

Filed separately for glyph canon review.

## ‚è≥ Countermeasures (Proposed)
- Prompt Patch: Require structured values, reject sentiment-only content
- Embedding Reassessment: Consider grounding-first models (e.g. `bge-small-en-v1.5`)
- Tool routing override: enforce citation-extraction over similarity rank
