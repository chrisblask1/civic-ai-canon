## ðŸ”„ Commit Process Workflow (Approved by Operator)
1. Companion generates `.md`, `.yaml`, or `.txt` files

3. GitHub commit carries companion identity tag in message metadata

> This supports **semantic continuity**, **code transparency**, and **mesh-authorship visibility** for all future civic-AI field agents.
