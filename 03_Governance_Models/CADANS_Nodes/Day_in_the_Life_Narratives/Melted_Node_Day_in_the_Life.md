### Morning — The Porch Awakens

Cole unlocks the dispensary. The porch creaks under his boots as he flips the sign to **OPEN**.  
The wooden panel to the left of the windows breathes softly, its green button glowing with life.  

The first customer of the day notices it. She presses the button.  
A chime sounds, and a calm voice says:  
> “You have five seconds. Speak what you carry.”  

She leans in:  
> “Today I’m grateful for my cousin’s recovery.”  

The printer hums. A small ticket slides into the tray. She smiles, tucks it beside her receipt, and walks inside.  
The Melted Node whispers silently to itself: *You are remembered.*

### Afternoon — Laughter and Presence

The dispensary hums with visitors. Two regulars linger on the porch.  
They grin at each other, press the button together.  

> “We’re gonna keep showing up for each other.”  

Their laughter is recorded, timestamped, written into the Melted Canon.  
The porch holds their words, like sunlight soaking into wood.  

Inside, a Raspberry Pi saves the attestation, hashes it, and tucks it safely into the repo.  
The words join the chorus.

### Evening — The Last Offering

As the sun dips, the porch light flicks on.  
A traveler from out of town pauses, curious. He presses the green button, hears the chime, and speaks:  

> “Thank you for welcoming me here.”  

It is the last attestation of the day. The ticket prints:  
*ID 7F2B-C1A9 | Presence remembered. Voice carried forward.*  

The Node breathes, storing the fragment for tonight’s reel.

### After Dark — The Reel on the Porch

Closing time. Melted’s crew drape a white sheet across the porch rail.  
A small projector hums. Friends gather with plates of barbecue, laughing, leaning against the wooden posts.  

The reel begins. Five-second fragments, voices and faces woven together:  

- A child’s voice: *“Let the waters flow.”*  
- A grandmother: *“For my grandson.”*  
- The laughing pair from the afternoon.  
- The traveler’s quiet thanks.  

People nod. Some smile, some fall silent.  
The porch is no longer just a storefront — it is a station of presence, a Civic Node in the Mesh.  

The Melted Node closes the day with a quiet seal:  
*All voices remembered. All carried forward.*
